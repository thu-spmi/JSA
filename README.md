Codes for reproducing experiments  in “Zhijian Ou, Yunfu Song. Joint Stochastic Approximation and its Application to Learning Discrete Latent Variable Models, UAI 2020”.

## Prerequistes

- Python 3.6
- PyTorch 1.0
- TensorFlow 1.8

## Usage

- For the generative modeling with Bernoulli variables experiment, please refer to **bernoulli_MNIST** folder.
- For the generative modeling with categorical variables  experiment, please refer to **categorical_MNIST** folder.
- For the structured output prediction  experiment, please refer to **structured_prediction** folder.

## Acknowledgments

The categorical MNIST experiments are based on the implementation [ARSM](https://github.com/ARM-gradient/ARSM).
